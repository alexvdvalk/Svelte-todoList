# One of my first svelte apps

This was one of my first svelte apps that was built in mid 2020. This was before Vite or Sveltekit.

It used:
* Bootstrap instead of Tailwind
* RXJS BehaviorSubjects instead of stores
* Page.js instead of Kit
  
I've converted this to a Vite + tailwind + typescript but it would have been much easier to just start from scratcH!

# TODO

Task item needs some CSS
